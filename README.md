# OnlineCourse

Hello! And welcome to one of my biggest project on my .net journey! 

Backend:
I created my own Web-api there you can create, read, update and delete courses and users. You can join courses through the api etc..
The API i secured through something called JWT authentication, where i spent alot of time to get it secured and to understand the logic behind it.
I spent many hours to create a login/register form through the front-end, more on that below. 

what i learned creating the backend?
mapper, repository pattern, dependency injection, middle ware, controller, services, routing, clean-code and what i love most, search and debugging. 
I searched the internet for tutorials like this but i never found anything, i spent hours on stack overflow, asked alot of questions
and so on. But im very proud of the result! i got top result and credit from my teachers. 


Front-end: 
The fun and boring parth starts here. I love backend and the logic, the front-end is not my strong side but i still like it sometimes,
specially when it works and you wonder why it works... why did it not work before but it just started to work after 2 days of resting? 
the biggest  problem i had was with the .js files to get the JsonResult and load it through a table. Sometimes it didnt show my table on the front-end
and after a couple of days it showed up again, those kind of parths made me scratch my head 02:00 a monday night when you have to work 08:00 same night.

But to the front-end: 
You can create, read, update and delete the API through the front-end. The problem i had here was to get the JWT token to work and how identity worked.
I have separately logic to the JSON result from the API, one for the Courses and one for the users. 

Have fun using my program, ask me anything you want. The comments can be swedish on some places becuase i always take notes in the code so i dont get confused 
when i start over. Same as the clean-code, i love to write clean codes so i can continue and develop the project. 


feel free to use it!
